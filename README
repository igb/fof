Fof is a MacOS application that captures the drawn X and Y points and creates a rough approximation of the underlying function by generating arrays of the drawn co-ordinates and creating interpolations in generated Java, JavaScript, Scala, and Python code.

Along with generating code you can also export a PNG of the graph.
